Starting this on my coding journey with JavaScript has been a roller coaster of emotions. Unraveling its intriguing features while grappling with the challenges posed by its flexibility has shaped a unique experiential learning curve. In delving into the intricacies of JavaScript, its flexibility emerges as a double-edged sword, providing a vast array of features but also introducing a realm of unexpected errors. As a novice coder, the absence of strict typing feels like a delicate balancing act without a safety net.

## Workouts of the Day: Real-Time Insights and High-Stakes Challenges
Workouts of the Day (WODs) have become a pivotal part of this class's learning journey, offering real-time glimpses into coding and problem-solving. They provide a platform for coders to showcase diverse programming approaches and insights. However, when viewed as part of a larger grading scale, the high-stakes pass-or-fail nature of WOD exercises can introduce an element of intensity and stress. This intensity may overshadow the inherent benefits of what WODs bring to the learning process.

## Skill-Based Evaluation: A Source of Concern
The skill-based evaluation of WODs intensifies the stress associated with them. As a student reliant on brute force, practice, and resourcefulness, the emphasis on what appears to be a skill check rather than an effort check raises concerns. The binary pass-or-fail nature may not fully accommodate diverse learning styles and skill levels, creating a challenging environment for beginners.

## Rethinking Evaluation: A Nuanced Approach
While WODs offer valuable insights, reevaluating the grading system to incorporate a more nuanced approach could contribute to a supportive learning environment. Acknowledging coding students' diverse strengths and learning styles ensures a more inclusive and effective educational experience. This new approach can help mitigate the stress associated with high-stakes evaluations and foster a more collaborative learning atmosphere.

As the semester progresses, I anticipate gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript and its applications in software engineering and web development. Despite the daunting nature of this new venture, I look forward to learning and utilizing JavaScript to its fullest extent. The challenges and stressors encountered along the way serve as stepping stones toward a more comprehensive understanding of JavaScript and coding principles, promising growth and proficiency in the ever-evolving coding landscape. This coding journey, though demanding, holds the potential for a fulfilling and rewarding experience in the world of programming.
