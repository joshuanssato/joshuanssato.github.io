In the early stages of my high school journey, I faced a formidable challenge as I harbored a strong dislike for school, leading to a tendency to skip classes and not turn in any schoolwork. This negative attitude was reflected in my academic performance, with initial GPAs of 2.2 and 2.5 during my freshman and sophomore years. This lack of engagement and motivation created a significant hurdle in my educational journey.

Realizing the need for change, I made a conscious decision to shift my mindset. I was determined to carve a path to personal and academic growth, I began to embrace the mindset of hard work and dedication, and this marked a shift in my approach, serving as a catalyst for resilience in the face of academic challenges.
