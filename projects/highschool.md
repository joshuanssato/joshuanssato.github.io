I began my high school journey with GPAs of 2.2 and 2.7 during my freshman and sophomore years, respectively. Through unwavering hard work and dedication, I successfully elevated my academic performance and concluded my senior year with a 3.7 GPA.

```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
