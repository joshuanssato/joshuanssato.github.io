Being a part of an Esports team is a rollercoaster of excitement, filled with exhilarating highs and the occasional challenge. The thrill of competing on a collegiate level against schools from across the country is unmatched, and there's a unique sense of pride that comes with playing for our school and striving to establish ourselves as champions in the Esports arena. The camaraderie formed within the team further enhances the overall experience, as we unite in the pursuit of victory.

However, this thrilling journey comes with its share of complexities, notably the delicate balance of being a full-time student while actively participating in tournaments and committing to 3-4 practice days. This dual commitment not only tests our gaming skills but also serves as a crash course in effective time management and project coordination. Juggling academic responsibilities with Esports demands a strategic approach to ensure success in both arenas.

In the realm of League of Legends, where strategic prowess is paramount, the team structure involves five starting players, each specializing in a specific role – top, jungle, mid, ADC, and support. Additionally, there's a 6th player or substitute who adds versatility to the team. Crafting advanced strategies in a game boasting over 140 playable characters and countless combinations is a formidable task. This aspect of Esports showcases not just gaming skills but also a remarkable display of project management capabilities.

Creating effective game plans, organizing practice sessions, and coordinating with five other players, all of whom are not only fellow students but also juggling part-time jobs, is no easy feat. This dynamic requires meticulous planning, the use of spreadsheets, and efficient communication to ensure that everyone is on the same page and ready to execute the devised strategies seamlessly.

In essence, being part of an Esports team goes beyond gaming proficiency; it's a holistic learning experience that sharpens time management, teamwork, and project management skills – all essential attributes that extend beyond the virtual battlefield and into various aspects of life.
